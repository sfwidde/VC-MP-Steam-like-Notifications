Please note what's shown in the video is quite old and therefore outdated. This implies some features being deprecated too.
## **Usage guide (client-side):**
- Two (PNG) files: `popup_bg.png` and `popup_logo.png` must be present in your `sprites` folder.
- Call `popupPool::PushPopup(string: message)` whenever you want to push a new pop-up.

This repo also includes a small script with an example on how to ask the client to push a new pop-up for a specific player alongside with a fancy sound being played.

_I DO NOT CLAIM OWNERSHIP OF THE FOLLOWING FILES: `popup_bg.png`, `s50000_camera1.wav` AND `s50001_message.wav` AS THEY ARE PROPERTY OF **VALVE CORPORATION**_.
